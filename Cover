Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently came across the opportunity to join your esteemed organization.

As indicated in my resume, I have a strong background in network automation, with hands-on experience using Python and Go to develop robust solutions for network operations. Notably, I have achieved significant time savings by streamlining configuration management and deployment processes for Palo Alto, F5, and Cisco ASA devices, while ensuring reliability and reducing errors.

I also worked as a Network Security Engineer with more focus on Palo Alto, Cisco, Checkpoint Firewalls.

I have also been coaching and guiding a junior team member, imparting practical skills in Python scripting, Ansible, and other automation technologies.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experience can add value to Zscaler.

Thanks & Regards, AJAY
